# QRCodeGenerator

Here I created a QR Code Generator using HTML , CSS and JavaScript . The generator allows users to input a message or URL and generate a QR code of desired size representing that input. The users can also download the generated QR code as an image file. The application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
